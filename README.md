# Auto Complete React component

The main goal of this project is to fulfill all acceptance criteria listed on the Deel Front-end Challenge.

There are many roads to take to build an AutoComplete React component, such as:

- Escalability: how well this component grows with different requirements
- Composability: how does this component adapt to other layouts
- Customizable: how many style options does this component offers to achieve different UI's.

For this challenge, the focus is on performance, while achieving all acceptance criteria listed on the document provided. The AutoComplete component works with asynchronous data, making focus on request call performance through a debounce feature. The previous three characteristics have been left out on purpose in order to fulfill the challenge. This helps by focusing time and effort on what's asked.
